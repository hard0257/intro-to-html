            <h2>About me</h2>
       
        <p>My name is Hardik. I am a curious and motivated person who loves learning new things. Right now, I am  working on improving my English and learning how to code. I enjoy exploring languages such as French, and I always try to push myself to become better every day.

         I recently started my first job, which is a new experience. I work hard, listen to others, and try to stay positive even when things are tough. I believe that small efforts every day can lead to big results. I want to grow into someone who is confident, skilled, and kind.</p>
